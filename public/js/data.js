Instead of a laugh track, Rose's \"the ditzy one\" lines were followed by the others looking deeply concerned for their 96-year-old friend. (Also, is anyone's still reading this stuff? For those interested, I'm far more active on the tweetybirds these days.)",

      "text": "I was dreaming last night of watching a standup comic, who was telling some really hilarious jokes I hadn't heard before. \"I wish I could steal these jokes,\" I thought to myself. The dream then started going a little lucid; I realized I was dreaming. This led me to realize, \"wait, if I'm dreaming, therse are my jokes!\" I resolved to remember them. Of course, when I woke up I remembered the dream but can't remember a damned one of the jokes.",

Surely an idea like this must have been done in fiction? At any rate, anyone who sees this is welcome to use it.",

      "text": "A man (sometimes it was me, but mostly it was a generic dude) was driving his sister (again sometimes it was my sister, mostly a generic lady) around when their car accidentally rear-ended someone else's. They start to panic and drive away at first, but quickly decide to do the right thing and pull over. They walk back to the car that's been hit, and it's being driven by a teenager who is near tears; he's terrified of what his parents will say. The brother and sister inspect the damage, offer to exchange information, make sure everything's paid for, etc. but the kid is unconsolable; he's crying that it was his first time driving his family's car on his own, his mom was going to kill him, etc. The kid lives not too far from where they are, so finally they offer to go back to his house with him and explain things to his family. They follow him to his house and he invites them in, offers them something to drink, and says he's going upstairs to get his mother. The brother and sister sit awkwardly on a couple of chairs sipping their drinks for a few minutes, but they slowly get drowsy and drift off, spilling their drinks. When they come to they've been tied to the chairs and the room is full of about 30-40 creepy-looking relatives, with the mother front and center and the kid next to her. He just has that annoyed/embarassed look not uncommon to teenage boys being spoken for by their moms, but all eyes are on the brother and sister as the mother furiously lists all the ways in which her son is going to punish them for what they did. The dream cuts to much later, as the brother - heavily injured and bleeding - crawls alone across the lawn back to the car, crying. It skips ahead again to the smoking remains of the car, still parked in front of the house.",

      "text": "A dream I had last night which is still sticking in my head was a bit sci-fi. There was a company who would, for a fee, give someone a treatment that would change their body to an animal of their choice for a limited time. It was something for rich and influential people to play around with, but the whole thing was actually a front; some agency (aliens?) were turning the clients into animals, but instead of changing them back afterward they'd change one of their own group into the person and take over their life. The story of what was going on was slowly beginning to leak out because one client, who'd been turned into a field mouse, re-learned how to talk as a mouse and was getting the story out. There's a mass-market CGI film in this somewhere.",

      "text": "Last night I dreamt I'd been attacked by someone on the way into my house, but was able to subdue him while my family called the police. I looked away from my attacker for a moment and looked back; he'd turned into a cat, but speaking with the same voice and demanding to be let go. I kept hold of him, but started to wonder how the police would react to a complaint about a talking cat. That was followed by a dream in which I was riding on a 19th century steam train with really cramped wooden seating, and I unsuccessfully tried to get myself a seat.",
